          <h2><b>About Me</b></h2>
          <img class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" src="resources/clubdayphoto.jpg" alt="Sierra College Club Day, Fall 2022" width="741" height="307"><br>
          <h3>This is a picture from Sierra College's 2022 Club Day. </h3>
          <p>I started attending Sierra College as a full-time student in the summer of 2021.
            In early spring 2022, I was approached by Sierra College's Young Developers club, who were looking for officers to lead the club.<br>
            While I first joined as a standard officer, I quickly rose to president by the beginning of summer, and led 
            lectures during club meetings, lecturing on various algorithms, techniques, and puzzles,
            along with encouraging my classmates to participate in programming competitions.<br>
            Spring 2023 is my last semester here. I will transfer to a University of California with an associate's degree,
            and pursue my graduate degree at university.<br><br>

            Despite all that I've learned at college, my greatest opportunity has been working with Rocklin's Code Ninjas team.
            I first joined the team in the fall of 2021, as a recommendation from my friend.
            Although it took me some time to realize it at first, my time at the code dojo was a huge eye-opener for me.
            Here, I learned all about competitive programming, along with the way of thinking needed to problem-solve effectively.<br>
            If Sierra College and my courses began my path in programming, Code Ninjas only added to my momentum.<br><br>

            My second best advice for aspiring computer scientists is to "think like a computer".
            Well, that's a strange statement- computers can't think! They're just programmed to execute certain routines,
            but cannot make decisions with complete independence from humans. When I say "thinking like a computer", I mean that
            you have to truly understand the flow and logic of code and algorithms.<br>
            Say you attend a lecture of a computer science class. That lecture shows you an algorithm, and explains what it does. 
            Then, on a homework assignment, you have to replicate that algorithm to solve a problem.<br>
            That's completely fine. But what if that probem has multiple parts? Knowing how to link multiple algorithms together,
            alongside having a mental outline of what the program's logic, is crucial to writing effective code.<br><br>

            There's one thing that is even be more important than the flow of logic, and that is simply passion for programming.
            You may be able to stuff a lot of knowledge in classes, but finding motivation outside of school will be difficult
            if you don't have any desire to code.<br>
            That is why, if you are an aspiring programmer, my greatest advice is to build some projects outside of school.
            Courses will teach you knowledge, but you will have to find the passion to apply that knowledge by yourself.
            Work on some personal projects- a to-do list is a very common project to begin with. While that is completely fine,
            it is infinitely better to find a project you are interested in. For me, that is Discord bots and automation.
            For you, it may be a game, a utility, an algorithm, or something else altogether.
            But find something that you are interested in, and you will learn all the while you build your dream project.

            <h3><b>Fours Puzzle</b></h3>
            <h5>
              I participated in 2022's Meta Hacker Cup, making my way through the qualification and first rounds.
              On the night of September 18th, I dreamed of a problem that would appear on Round 2: 
              a puzzle involving the number 4, and four mathematical operations. Unfortunately, it didn't actually appear on the contest!
            </h5>
            <p>
              Given a finite amount of the number 4, and the mathematical operations +, -, *, and ÷, determine whether it is possible or not to produce a result using those operations.<br><br>
              
              Input will be formatted as follows. The first line will be an integer number of how many inputs there will be. For each input, there will be two positive integers N and K separated by a space. The first integer N is how many 4’s you are allowed to use. The second integer K is the number to calculate.<br>
              1 <= N <= 10<br>
              0 <= K <= 1,000,000<br><br>
              
              Example input:<br>
              3 2<br>
              5 1<br>
              3 10<br>
              1 0<br><br>
              
              In Case 1, we are given three 4s to get the number 2 as a result. We can do: <b>(4 + 4) / 4</b> to return the number 2.<br>
              In Case 2, we are given five 4s to get the number 1. We can do: <b>4 / 4</b> to return the number 1. The number of 4s we use does not have to be exactly N, but has to be less or equal to N.<br>
              In Case 3, we are given three 4s to get 10. 10 can be found with <b>4 + 4 + (4 + 4) / 4</b>; however, we print NO because we used more than three 4s.<br>
              In Case 4, with only one 4, our only possible result is 4. Therefore, we cannot get a result of 0.<br><br>

              The answer of this puzzle is the sum of the valid inputs' case numbers.<br>
              For example, for the example input, the first and second inputs are valid, but the third and fourth are not, so I would add 1 and 2 to get a solution of 3.

            <h5>
              I dreamed of the basic premise of this puzzle on the 24th of December, after reading about a puzzle with (possibly) a similar solution.
              I later added onto it, while I was awake.
            </h5>
            <p>
              A mouse is running through a maze, represented by a 2D grid, shown below. A # represents a wall, and a . represents an empty tile. 
              Each second, it can move one tile upwards, leftwards, rightwards, or downwards on an empty space, but cannot go through walls. 
              The mouse starts on the space marked A, and wants to move to the space marked B.<br><br>
              Around the maze are one or more powerups marked P. The mouse has to collect every tile marked P in order to complete the maze.
              Whenever the mouse moves over a space marked P, it can choose to collect the powerup. If it does, the space becomes an empty tile, and the mouse's current second ends.
              On subsequent moves, the mouse is able to move an additional tile for every powerup collected.<br><br>
              Given a maze, return the least amount of time the mouse takes to reach point B, starting from point A.<br>
              Here is an example, along with an explanation. Press the buttons to go forward or backward a move.
            </p><br>

            <pre>{{currentMaze}}</pre>
            <p><pre>{{currentExplanation}}</pre></p>
            <p>Current second: {{index}}</p> <button @click="prev" :disabled='lowest'>Previous</button> <button @click="next" :disabled='highest'>Next</button><br><br>
