              I participated in 2022's Meta Hacker Cup, making my way through the qualification and first rounds.
              On the night of September 18th, I dreamed of a problem that would appear on Round 2: 
              a puzzle involving the number 4, and four mathematical operations. Unfortunately, it didn't actually appear on the contest!
            </h5>
            <p>
              Given a finite amount of the number 4, and the mathematical operations +, -, *, and ÷, determine whether it is possible or not to produce a result using those operations.<br><br>
              
              Input will be formatted as follows. The first line will be an integer number of how many inputs there will be. For each input, there will be two positive integers N and K separated by a space. The first integer N is how many 4’s you are allowed to use. The second integer K is the number to calculate.<br>
              1 <= N <= 10<br>
              0 <= K <= 1,000,000<br><br>
              
              For each case, output the case number, along with if K is able to be calculated.<br><br>
              
              Example input:<br>
              4<br>
              3 2<br>
              5 1<br>
              3 10<br>
              1 0<br><br>
              
              Output, given that example input:<br>
              Case #1: YES<br>
              Case #2: YES<br>
              Case #3: NO<br>
              Case #4: NO<br>
              
              In Case 1, we are given three 4s to get the number 2 as a result. We can do: <b>(4 + 4) / 4</b> to return the number 2.<br>
              In Case 2, we are given five 4s to get the number 1. We can do: <b>4 / 4</b> to return the number 1. The number of 4s we use does not have to be exactly N, but has to be less or equal to N.<br>
              In Case 3, we are given three 4s to get 10. 10 can be found with <b>4 + 4 + (4 + 4) / 4</b>; however, we print NO because we used more than three 4s.<br>
              In Case 4, with only one 4, our only possible result is 4. Therefore, we cannot get a result of 0.

            <h3><b>Power-up Maze</b></h3>
            <h5>
              I can't remember too well the origin of this puzzle. 
              I believe I dreamed of it on the 24th of December, after reading about a puzzle with (possibly) a similar solution. 
            </h5>
            <p>
              A mouse is running through a maze, represented by a 2D grid, shown below. A # represents a wall, and a . represents an empty tile. 
              Each second, it can move one tile upwards, leftwards, rightwards, or downwards on an empty space, but cannot go through walls. 
              The mouse starts on the space marked A, and wants to move to the space marked B.<br><br>
              Around the maze are two powerups marked P. The mouse must move over every tile marked P in order to complete the maze.
              Whenever the mouse moves over a space marked P, the space becomes an empty tile, and 
              the mouse is able to move an additional tile per second (not counting its current turn).<br><br>
            </p><br><br>
