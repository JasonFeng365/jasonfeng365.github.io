          <h5>Although most messages are straightforward in meaning, some have a secret, hidden message within.
            You're given a ton of messages- look at each one individually and it won't make sense, but look at them all together and find the hidden message!
          </h5>
          <p>
            You are given a list of 200 all-lowercase strings. Each string is 15 words or less, and 150 characters or less.
            Instead of looking at each string one by one though, look at the columns, starting from the leftmost column.
            Select the word that is the greatest lexiographically, compared to the other words.
            Then, done with all strings, put all of the selected words together to form the secret message.<br>
            Your input will look like this- with more sentences, of course.<br><br>
            i in atechnic moo cheesecakes<br>
            hello just armadillo nineteen blueberries<br>
            great eight ate bait<br><br>
            In this case, the first column is [i, hello, great]. The word <b>i</b> comes after both the words <b>hello</b> and <b>great</b>, so the first word is <b>i</b>.<br>
            The second column is [in, just, eight]. The word <b>just</b> is selected, as it is the greatest. The second word is <b>just</b>.<br>
            The third column is [atechnic, armadillo, ate]. <b>atechnic</b> and <b>ate</b> both start with "ate", but <b>ate</b> is selected, because it is shorter, despite starting with the same letters. The third word is <b>ate</b>.<br>
            The fourth column is [moo, nineteen, bait]. The fourth word is <b>nineteen</b>.<br>
            The fifth and last column is [cheesecakes, blueberries]. Note that the third row is only four words long, so it is not in the third column. The last word is <b>cheesecakes</b>.<br>
            Putting all those words together yields the sentence: <b>i just ate nineteen cheesecakes</b>. Delicious.
