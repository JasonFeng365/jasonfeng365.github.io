            <h3><b>Even Sum 1</b></h3>
            <h5>This puzzle is very similar in concept to Odd Sum.</h5>
            <p>
              For a positive integer <b>n</b>, its <b>even sum</b> is the sum of every even integer less than or equal to <b>n</b>.<br>
              For example, given n=6, 12 should be returned (2 + 4 + 6), and given n=5, 6 should be returned (2 + 4).<br><br>
              Given a list of positive integers, output the sum of their even sums. For example:<br>
              3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br><br>
              Given this list, 26 should be output. The even sum of 3 is 2, the even sum of 4 is 6, the even sum of 5 is 6, and the even sum of 6 is 12. Adding these together yields 26.<br>
              The large input set has 100,000 integers, and will result in a sum that is very large. <b>To keep the output small, take the remainder of the output divided by 1000007 (10^6 + 7).</b> The maximum value of each n is 30,000.
            </p><br>
