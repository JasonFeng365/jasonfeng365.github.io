            <h3><b>Prime ID</b></h3>
            <h5>Find all the factors of a very large number.</h5>
            <p>
              For a positive integer, its <b>prime factorization</b> is a list of all the prime numbers, which when multiplied together,
              results in the original integer. For example, the prime factorization of 90 is [2, 3, 3, 5], because 2 * 3 * 3 * 5 is 90.<br><br>
              That number's <b>prime ID</b> is the sum of each factor, multiplied by that factor's frequency. For 90, the prime ID is calculated as such:<br>
              <b>(2 * 1) + (3 * 2) + (5 * 1)</b><br>
              2, 3, and 5 are from the prime factorization. In said factorization, 2 occurs once, 3 occurs twice, and 5 occurs once,
              so 2 is multiplied by 1, 3 by 2, and 5 by 1. Then, all of these are added together for a final answer of <b>13</b>.
            </p><br>
