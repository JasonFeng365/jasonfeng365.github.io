            <h3><b>Odd Sum</b></h3>
            <h5>
              This puzzle is originally from a friend of mine's MATLAB assignment. I changed it to be more competition-like. Try and find the O(n) solution.
            </h5>
            <p>
              For a positive integer <b>n</b>, its <b>odd sum</b> is the sum of every odd integer less than or equal to <b>n</b>.<br>
              For example, given n=5, 9 should be returned (1 + 3 + 5), and given n=4, 4 should be returned (1 + 3).<br><br>
              Given a list of positive integers, output the sum of their odd sums. For example:<br>
              3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br><br>
              Given this list, 26 should be output. The odd sum of 3 is 4, the odd sum of 4 is 4, the odd sum of 5 is 9, and the odd sum of 6 is 9. Adding these together yields 26.<br>
              <b>The large input set will result in a sum that is very large. To keep the output small, take the remainder of the output divided by 1000007 (10^6 + 7).</b>
            </p><br>
