            <h5>Pour water on a canyon to make a waterfall!</h5>
            <p>
              You want to make a waterfall by pouring water all the way down a canyon!
              This canyon is a grid of tiles with various heights, with each height represented as a single-digit number.
              The grid is given as a square grid, with width and height of 100 digits.
              The very bottom of the canyon is marked with <b>0</b>, and there is only one 0 in the entire canyon.<br><br>
              Water can begin on any spot on the canyon, but can only flow to tiles directly above, below, left of, and right of the current tile.
              It can only flow to tiles with a number less than or equal to the current number.
              For instance, it can flow from a tile marked 5 to a tile marked 2, or from a tile marked 2 to another tile marked 2, but cannot flow from 6 to 8.
              Water can begin on any tile, but has to end on the tile marked 0.<br><br>
              Find the number of starting points that allow water to reach the bottom of the canyon.
              Here is an example, along with an explanation.
