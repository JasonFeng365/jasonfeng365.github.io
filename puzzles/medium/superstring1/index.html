          <h5>Find how many times a substring appears- with a twist.</h5>
          <p>
            What's the opposite of substring? I guess superstring will have to do.<br><br>
            You are given a superstring, which is a string filled with 1, 0, and the underscore _, in no specific order.
            You are also given a substring, which is a shorter string, filled with only 1 and 0.
            This has no specific order either, and there are no underscores in the substring.
            For example, an input can look like this:<br><br>
            
            10__00_001001<br>
            1001<br><br>

            With a superstring and a substring, determine how many different places where the substring can fit into the superstring.
            The underscores in the superstring are wildcard characters- they can be either 1 or 0.<br>
            In this example, it's possible to fit in the substring at <b>4</b> different indices.<br>
            It can be fit in at index 0, by setting the underscore at index 2 to a 0, and the underscore at index 3 to a 1.<br>
            It can be fit in at index 3, by setting the underscore at index 3 to a 1, and the underscore at index 6 to a 1.<br>
            It can be fit in at index 6, by setting the underscore at index 6 to a 1.<br>
            Finally, it can be fit in at index 9, without needing to set any underscores.<br><br>

            Given a 1,000 character superstring and a 20 character substring, find the number of different places the substring can be fit in.
