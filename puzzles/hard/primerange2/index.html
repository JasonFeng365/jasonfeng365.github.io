            <h5>Find the amount of prime numbers between a range.</h5>
            <p>
              There are <b>4</b> prime numbers in between 2 and 7, inclusive.<br>
              There is <b>1</b> prime number in between 11 and 11, inclusive, and <b>0</b> prime numbers in between 12 and 12, inclusive.<br>
              You are given a list of 100 thousand ranges. For each range, find the amount of prime numbers, inclusive, in that range. Then, add those sums together. To keep input small, your final answer will be the remainder of that sum divided by 1,000,007.<br><br>
              Ranges will be formatted as follows:<br>
              5 50<br>
              Each of the 100,000 lines consists of a range. Each range consists of two positive integers. Each integer is guaranteed to be greater or equal to 2, and less than or equal to 1,000,000. The left number is guaranteed to be less than or equal to the right number.
