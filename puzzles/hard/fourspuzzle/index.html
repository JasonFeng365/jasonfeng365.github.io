              I participated in 2022's Meta Hacker Cup, making my way through the qualification and first rounds.
              On the night of September 18th, I dreamed of a problem that would appear on Round 2: 
              a puzzle involving the number 4, and four mathematical operations. Unfortunately, it didn't actually appear on the contest!
            </h5>
            <p>
              Given a finite amount of the number 4, and the mathematical operations +, -, *, and ÷, determine whether it is possible or not to produce a result using those operations.<br><br>
              
              Input will be formatted as follows. The first line will be an integer number of how many inputs there will be. For each input, there will be two positive integers N and K separated by a space. The first integer N is how many 4’s you are allowed to use. The second integer K is the number to calculate.<br>
              1 <= N <= 10<br>
              0 <= K <= 1,000,000<br><br>
              
              Example input:<br>
              3 2<br>
              5 1<br>
              3 10<br>
              1 0<br><br>
              
              In Case 1, we are given three 4s to get the number 2 as a result. We can do: <b>(4 + 4) / 4</b> to return the number 2.<br>
              In Case 2, we are given five 4s to get the number 1. We can do: <b>4 / 4</b> to return the number 1. The number of 4s we use does not have to be exactly N, but has to be less or equal to N.<br>
              In Case 3, we are given three 4s to get 10. 10 can be found with <b>4 + 4 + (4 + 4) / 4</b>; however, we print NO because we used more than three 4s.<br>
              In Case 4, with only one 4, our only possible result is 4. Therefore, we cannot get a result of 0.<br><br>

              The answer of this puzzle is the sum of the valid inputs' case numbers.<br>
              For example, for the example input, the first and second inputs are valid, but the third and fourth are not, so I would add 1 and 2 to get a solution of 3.
