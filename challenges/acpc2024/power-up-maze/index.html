			<p>Power-up Maze is my second ever challenge, which came to me a dream on Christmas Eve 2022. I dreamed of the basic premise of this puzzle on the 24th of December, after reading about a puzzle with (possibly) a similar solution.</p>
			<p>The first and current iteration of the problem involved the power-ups increasing the tiles you can move on a single turn. I simplified this problem into a similar problem of simply collecting all powerups with no speed increase, which I linked as the related challenge: Cheese Maze.</p>
			<p>Hilariously enough, Cheese Maze saved me during a contest that Lego hosted in 2023! I entered the contest with a meme team of my best friend and my mom, and was able to implement Cheese Maze in mere minutes after seeing one of the problems was very similar to it.</p>
