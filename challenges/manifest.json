The first and current iteration of the problem involved the power-ups increasing the tiles you can move on a single turn. I once simplified this problem into a similar legacy problem - Cheese Maze - of simply collecting all powerups with no speed increase.\nHilariously enough, Cheese Maze saved me during a contest that Lego hosted in 2023!
