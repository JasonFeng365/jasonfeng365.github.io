            <h5>
              I dreamed of the basic premise of this puzzle on the 24th of December, after reading about a puzzle with (possibly) a similar solution.
              I later added onto it, while I was awake.
            </h5>
            <p>
              A mouse is running through a maze, represented by a 2D grid, shown below. A # represents a wall, and a . represents an empty tile. 
              Each second, it can move one tile upwards, leftwards, rightwards, or downwards on an empty space, but cannot go through walls. 
              The mouse starts on the space marked A, and wants to move to the space marked B.<br><br>
              Around the maze are one or more powerups marked P. The mouse has to collect every tile marked P in order to complete the maze.
              Whenever the mouse moves over a space marked P, it can choose to collect the powerup. If it does, the space becomes an empty tile, and the mouse's current second ends.
              On subsequent moves, the mouse is able to move an additional tile for every powerup collected.<br><br>
              Given a maze, return the least amount of time the mouse takes to reach point B, starting from point A.<br>
              Here is an example, along with an explanation. Press the buttons to go forward or backward a move.
